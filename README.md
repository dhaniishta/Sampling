# Sampling Assignment

## Overview
This project applies various sampling techniques to balance a credit card dataset and evaluates the performance of five different machine learning models. The goal is to determine which sampling technique yields the highest accuracy for each model.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from the link:
[Creditcard_data.csv](https://github.com/AnjulaMehto/Sampling_Assignment/blob/main/Creditcard_data.csv).

## Sampling Techniques
The following sampling techniques were applied:
1. **Sampling1:** No sampling applied.
2. **Sampling2:** Random Undersampling.
3. **Sampling3:** SMOTE.
4. **Sampling4:** SMOTEENN.
5. **Sampling5:** TomekLinks.

## Models Used
The following machine learning models were used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Classifier
4. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Results
The results of the sampling techniques and their corresponding accuracies for each model are stored in the following files:
- `results.csv`: Contains accuracy scores for each sampling technique and model combination.
- `best_accuracies.csv`: Contains the highest accuracy for each model.
